# Exploring Temporal: Failure-Proofing Your Python Code

A hands-on course designed by the Temporal Solution Architecture Team to teach developers how to use [Temporal](https://temporal.io/) to make Python code failure-proof and resilient.

**Authors:** Laine Smith and Josh Smith

This course is designed to be used with [Instruqt](https://instruqt.com/) for interactive learning.

## Course Outline

This course consists of four modules that progressively build your understanding of Temporal's failure-proofing capabilities:

1. [Module 1: Exploring Crash-Proof](01-module-01/) - Learn the fundamentals of making your code crash-resistant
2. [Module 2: Exploring Simpler Retries](02-module-02/) - Implement robust retry mechanisms with minimal complexity
3. [Module 3: Exploring Failure-Proof Downstream Systems](03-module-03/) - Handle failures in external dependencies and services
4. [Module 4: Exploring Bug-Resistant Development](04-module-04/) - Develop patterns that prevent and handle bugs gracefully

## Getting Started

The exercises are located in the [exercises/](exercises/) directory and include practical Python examples that demonstrate Temporal's capabilities in real-world scenarios.
